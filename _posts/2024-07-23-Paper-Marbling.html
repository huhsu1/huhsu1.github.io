Paper Marbling. <br>
Right click to drop paint onto canvas.
The paint drop was from this <a
href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/jaffer/Marbling/Dropping-Paint">website</a>. <br>
The combing is done by left clicking and dragging. <br>
The combing calculation is from this <a
href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/jaffer/Marbling/stroke.pdf">paper</a>. <br>
I tweaked a couple calculations, like x = xb, y = (P-B) x N to get rid of unnecessary
calculations. <br>
Currently, everything is done on CPU. After making many circles, the latency starts to be
noticible.
