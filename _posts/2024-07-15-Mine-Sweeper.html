title: MineSweeper
---

<p>Since I didn't have internet access during my time in the military, I often wrote minesweeper
on computers that I would use often to play when there is downtime. Here is a simple one
similar to what I would write in the military to celebrate the website launch. </p>


<canvas id="canvas" width="400" height="400"></canvas>
<script src="{{ base.url | prepend: site.url }}/scripts/minesweeper/minesweeper.js"> </script>

<p> For those of you who might need a refresher: <br>
The goal of the game is to reveal all tiles that don't contain the mines.<br>
<br>
You can left click to open tiles you think is safe. <br>
The numbers tell you how many mines are in a 3x3 square around the number. <br>
So, if the number says 1, there is only 1 mine in a 3x3 square. <br>
<br>
If you think there is a mine in a square, right click. It will put a flag down. <br>
You can right click a flag to remove the flag. <br>
Flag makes it so that you can't left click that square, to prevent you from accidentally
clicking it. <br>
<br>
You can double click an open tile to click a 3x3 square around the number. <br>
If you have all the mines around that tile flagged, use this feature to click less.
